## Arda: 
Designing a good-looking user interface proved to be quite difficult, and unfortunately I have failed at how good it looks. Looks aside, I managed to implement the basic UI elements and functionality for the welcome screen and game setup screen. 

Testing certain functions and keeping up with refactored code was challenging. The reviews of my PRs by my teammates helped me resolve that issue. 

## Laurynas:
What I did: Implemented sign in and log in with email and password and authentication with firebase, tested them. Implmeneted a signin with Google.

What problems did I encounter: I had some problems testing and with button placement on the UI. I did underestimate how much time I will spend on implementing test

What I'll do next week: I'll link the auth users to the profiles and implement chaning the names and handle

## Maxime: 
I first implemented the music API using volley. It was working fine but impossible to test correctly. Therefore I decided to change to okHttp where I can use CompletableFuture in order to test our API access correctly. That's why my time estimation was wrong, I should have planned my things better before trying and doing things twice. 

For the next time I would first look at other implementations on the web, and how easy is a library easy to test before implementing it. 

On a positive note, I had a great fun doing my API implementation! 

## Kamila: 
I managed to implement both of my tasks, but I have struggled in the beginning of my sprint to start them. The problem was that I was thinking too globally, and later struggled to combine the UI and backend. Also I need to practice writing tests more. 

In hindsight, I should have started my tasks ealier, so I can think of my tasks  more and do them in a better way. 

On a positive note, my teammates were very helpful when I have any questions or struggles. 

## Margaux: 
I implemented the game screen with the buzzers, which was challening but helped me familiarise myself with xml layouts and creating views programmatically. 

I had trouble importing and using a library (robolectric) to test part of the code: I will look into this in the next sprint. As an alternative, I tried adapting my code to use features that are testable with the basic libraries (JUnit and Espresso), but I did not have time to fix some bugs that this caused so I reverted to the previous implementation.  

In hindsight, I should have started focusing on the testing earlier on in the sprint. 

## Jiabao: 
I am happy that I finished my task and achieved 100% coverage. 

The testing took me longer than I thought. I didn't know how to test and spent some time looking for it. But it will be better next time. 

## Overall team: 
We managed to implement most if not all of the user stories we were looking at. For some of us, testing proved more challenging than we expected, which made some of us overwork.  

Our team coordination was good, we did two stand up meetings and helped each other resolve issues when needed. 

With most team members having a busy start of the week, our workflow was intense towards the end of the sprint, which is an issue that will be discussed.
