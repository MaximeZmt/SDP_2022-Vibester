This is the GitHub repository of our Android App Vibester!

The purpose of the application is entertainment and fun. The userâ€™s goal is to guess a song by its short fragment. Players will compete with each other to be first in the ranking. Moreover, players could play with others, where one player sings and the other tries to guess the song.

There will be different modes in the game: (i) guess the song by name, and (ii) finish the lyrics. The game will have different categories of songs to choose from: pop, rock, jazz, classical, hits, etc. In the first mode the user can guess the artist and the song name in a text format or from a multiple choice. In the second mode the user can finish the song lyrics in a text format or with a microphone.

The game will also offer a customization where the user can create a game from its own list of songs.
